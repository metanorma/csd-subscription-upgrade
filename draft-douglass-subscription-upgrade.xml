<abstract><t>This specification introduces an approach to allow subscribers to
calendar feeds to upgrade to a more performant protocol.</t>
<t>This specification updates <xref target="RFC5545"/> to add the value DELETED to the
STATUS property.</t>
<t>This specification also updates <xref target="RFC7240"/> to add the subscribe-
enhanced-get and sync-token preferences.</t></abstract>
</front><middle>
<section anchor="introduction" title="Introduction"><t>Currently clients subscribe to calendar feeds as an ics file which is
often published as a resource accessible using the unofficial
'webcal' scheme.</t>
<t>The only available option for updating that resource is the usual
HTTP polling of cached resources using Etags.</t>
<t>There is the usual tension between clients wishing to see a timely
response to changes and servers not wishing to be overloaded by
frequent requests for possibly large amounts of data.</t>
<t>This specification introduces an approach whereby clients can
discover a more performant access method.  Given the location of the
resource as an ics file, the client can perfom an HEAD request on the
resource and inspect the returned headers which will offer a number
of alternative access methods.</t>
<t>Given that many clients already support CalDAV this provides an easy
upgrade path for those clients.  CalDAV and DAV subsets are specified
here to allow lighter weight implementations.</t></section>
<section anchor="conventions" title="Terms and Definitions">

"<spanx style="strong">NOT RECOMMENDED</spanx>", "<spanx style="strong">MAY</spanx>", and "<spanx style="strong">OPTIONAL</spanx>" in this document are to be
interpreted as described in BCP 14 <xref target="RFC2119"/> <xref target="RFC8174"/> when, and
only when, they appear in all capitals, as shown here.</t>
</section>
<section anchor="terms" title="Terms and definitions"/>
<section anchor="enhanced-get" title="Enhanced GET"><section anchor="_general" title="General"><t>This is a lightweight protocol which allows simple clients to
efficiently discover and download changes in the targeted resource.</t>
<t>It has many similarities to WebDAV sync and for a server could be
implemented as an extension of the specification.</t>
<t>In this protocol the client <spanx style="strong">MUST</spanx> include the Prefer header field
preference "subscribe-enhanced-get".  If a sync token is available it
is passed as a parameter to that preference.</t>
<t>The client <spanx style="strong">MAY</spanx> include the Prefer header field preference
"handling=strict".  If included and an invalid sync-token is passed
in the request the server <spanx style="strong">MUST</spanx> return an error response instead of a
full set of data.</t>
<t>The resource is treated as a set of individual events each of which
may be updated or deleted separately.  The client will first fetch
the entire ics file.  On subsequent requests it uses the Prefer
header with a "sync-token" parameter to indicate that it wants a set
of changes since the last fetch.</t></section>
<section anchor="_deletions" title="Deletions"><t>When an entity (VEVENT, VTODO or other valid top-level component) is
deleted from the source data the server needs to be able to inform a
client of the deletion.  This specification introduces a new value
for the STATUS property of DELETED.</t>
<t>On the first enhanced GET after the entity has been deleted a
skeleton, but valid, entity will be returned with STATUS: DELETED.
The receiving client is free to remove the entity or update it&#8217;s
STATUS property.</t>
<t>On subsequent fetches the entity will not be returned.</t></section>
<section anchor="_handling_of_invalid_sync_tokens" title="Handling of invalid sync tokens"><t>The default behavior is to treat an invalid sync token as if none
were supplied.  This will result in all data being returned with a
new valid token.</t>
<t>For some clients and with some very large sets of data, such behavior
may be problematic.  To suppress the return of data on an invalid
token the client should include the Prefer header field preference
"handling=strict".</t>
<t>When a server receives an invalid token and the "handling=strict"
preference is supplied, the server <spanx style="strong">MUST</spanx> return a 412 status,
precondition failed.  The server <spanx style="strong">MAY</spanx> choose to return an error
message in the body.</t>
<t>The client <spanx style="strong">SHOULD</spanx> respond to this error by restarting the interaction
from scratch, i.e. retrieve the full set of data then poll for
updates.</t></section>
<section anchor="_paging_the_response" title="Paging the response"><t>A client may explicitly request a limit on the size of the response
by specifying the Prefer header field preference "limit=n" where n is
the number of components.</t>
<t>When a server receives a request specifying such a limit it SHOULD
limit the response to that number of components.  If the limit causes
a truncation in the response the server should respond with WHAT? and
return a sync token which may be used to retrieve the next batch of
data.</t>
<t>The truncated status allows the client to immediately resubmit a
request for the next batch.</t>
<t>A server <spanx style="strong">MAY</spanx> choose to limit the response size.  The behavior SHOULD
be as if the client had provided a preference for that size -
allowing the client to retrieve the full set of data in batches.</t></section>
<section anchor="_caching_of_responses" title="Caching of responses"><t>To enable proper caching of responses the server <spanx style="strong">SHOULD</spanx> provide a
VARY header field in responses that names the Prefer header field
along with any other that are appropriate.</t>
<t>Clients should order the preferences in the following manner so that
identical responses can be identified&#8230;&#8203;<cref>need to discuss this further and check on the HTTP specs to
ensure this makes sense.</cref></t>
