== Changes to the iCalendar specifications

This specification updates <<RFC5545>> to add the value DELETED to the
STATUS property.

=== Redefined Status property

Property name:: STATUS

Purpose:: This property defines the overall status or confirmation
  for the calendar component.

Value Type::  TEXT

Property Parameters::  IANA and non-standard property parameters can
  be specified on this property.

Conformance::  This property can be specified once in "VEVENT",
  "VTODO", or "VJOURNAL" calendar components.

Description::  In a group-scheduled calendar component, the property
  is used by the "Organizer" to provide a confirmation of the event
  to the "Attendees".  For example in a "VEVENT" calendar component,
  the "Organizer" can indicate that a meeting is tentative,
  confirmed, or cancelled.  In a "VTODO" calendar component, the
  "Organizer" can indicate that an action item needs action, is
  completed, is in process or being worked on, or has been
  cancelled.  In a "VJOURNAL" calendar component, the "Organizer"
  can indicate that a journal entry is draft, final, or has been
  cancelled or removed.
